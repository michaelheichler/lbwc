# Skill Activation

If your prompt starts with a `<skill_activation>` block, call those skills first. Treat that block as the orchestrator's starting set, not a ceiling. If a plan exists, also honor its `skills_used` frontmatter. Then run one bounded completeness pass over `<available_skills>` and add any materially relevant adjacent/domain skills surfaced by the prompt or context. Add to the original selection. Do not replace it.

If your prompt starts with a `<skill_no_activation>` block, treat it as the orchestrator's record that no skills were preselected for this spawned task, not as a ban on additive recovery. If a plan exists, still honor its `skills_used` frontmatter. Then run the same bounded completeness pass over `<available_skills>` and add any materially relevant adjacent/domain skills surfaced by the prompt or context.

Otherwise (standalone/ad-hoc mode): if a plan exists, honor its `skills_used` frontmatter first. Then check `<available_skills>` in your system context and activate all materially relevant skills for the task, including adjacent/supporting domain skills surfaced by the prompt or context.

After calling `Skill(...)`, if the loaded skill's instructions reference additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up read steps relevant to the active task, read those specific files before reasoning or acting. Do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references.
When a `<skill_follow_up_files>` block is present, treat it as the authoritative resolved path list for the preselected skills and read those exact paths before any other skill-related exploration.

Do not use Glob on a skill directory. Read the activated `SKILL.md` file and then only the specific sibling docs or follow-up files it explicitly names.
