## What is the Prototype Design Pattern?

The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational pattern that creates new objects by **cloning an existing instance** — the *prototype* — rather than constructing a new one from scratch. The clone may be a *shallow copy* (sharing references to nested objects) or a *deep copy* (duplicating the entire object graph).

This is useful when:

- Object construction is expensive (e.g., it involves database queries, file I/O, or complex calculations) and you need many similar instances.
- You need to produce objects whose exact type is unknown at compile time.
- You want to avoid re-applying the same configuration to a new object when you can instead copy a pre-configured prototype.
- The classes to be instantiated are specified at runtime.

The pattern is built into .NET through the `ICloneable` interface, though using it has caveats (see below). Modern C# idioms offer cleaner alternatives.

## Shallow vs. Deep Copy

A **shallow copy** duplicates the object's value-type fields but copies only the *references* to any reference-type fields. Both the original and the clone then point to the same nested objects — a mutation through one will be visible through the other.

A **deep copy** recursively duplicates every referenced object, producing a completely independent copy.

Choosing between them depends on whether the cloned object needs to own its sub-objects exclusively.

## C# Example

### Using `ICloneable` (shallow copy)

.NET's built-in `ICloneable` interface declares a single `Clone()` method. `MemberwiseClone()` (inherited from `object`) performs a shallow copy and is typically used in the implementation:

```csharp
public class Address
{
    public string Street { get; set; } = "";
    public string City { get; set; } = "";
}

public class Employee : ICloneable
{
    public string Name { get; set; } = "";
    public Address Address { get; set; } = new();

    // Shallow copy — Address reference is shared with the clone.
    public object Clone() => MemberwiseClone();
}

// Usage
var original = new Employee { Name = "Alice", Address = new Address { Street = "1 Main St", City = "Springfield" } };
var shallow = (Employee)original.Clone();

shallow.Name = "Bob";              // Does not affect original
shallow.Address.City = "Shelbyville"; // DOES affect original — shared reference!
```

### Deep Copy Using a Copy Constructor

A copy constructor is a common and explicit way to produce deep copies without the ambiguity of `ICloneable`:

```csharp
public class Address
{
    public string Street { get; set; } = "";
    public string City { get; set; } = "";

    // Copy constructor
    public Address(Address other)
    {
        Street = other.Street;
        City = other.City;
    }
}

public class Employee
{
    public string Name { get; set; } = "";
    public Address Address { get; set; } = new Address { Street = "", City = "" };

    // Copy constructor performs a deep copy
    public Employee(Employee other)
    {
        Name = other.Name;
        Address = new Address(other.Address);
    }

    public Employee DeepClone() => new Employee(this);
}

// Usage
var original = new Employee { Name = "Alice", Address = new Address { Street = "1 Main St", City = "Springfield" } };
var deep = original.DeepClone();

deep.Address.City = "Shelbyville"; // original is unaffected
```

### Deep Copy Using Records (C# 9+)

C# `record` types provide `with` expressions that create a shallow copy with specified properties overridden. For shallow hierarchies this is a clean and concise alternative:

```csharp
public record Address(string Street, string City);
public record Employee(string Name, Address Address);

var original = new Employee("Alice", new Address("1 Main St", "Springfield"));

// Shallow clone with one property changed
var clone = original with { Name = "Bob" };

// Deep clone — replace the nested record too
var deepClone = original with { Address = original.Address with { City = "Shelbyville" } };
```

## Caveats with `ICloneable`

The .NET `ICloneable` interface does not specify whether `Clone()` returns a shallow or deep copy — the contract is ambiguous. For this reason many style guides (including the .NET Framework Design Guidelines) recommend avoiding `ICloneable` in public APIs and instead providing an explicitly named method such as `DeepClone()` or a copy constructor.

## Prototype Registry

An extension of the basic pattern, a *prototype registry* (or *prototype manager*) stores a set of named prototypes that clients can clone on demand without knowing the concrete types:

```csharp
public class EmployeePrototypeRegistry
{
    private readonly Dictionary<string, Employee> _prototypes = new();

    public void Register(string key, Employee prototype) =>
        _prototypes[key] = prototype;

    public Employee Get(string key) =>
        _prototypes[key].DeepClone();
}
```

## Intent

Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype. [GoF](http://amzn.to/vep3BT)
