## What is the MVC Pattern?

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components:

- **Model** — represents the application's data, business logic, and rules. The model is independent of the UI; it knows nothing about how it is displayed.
- **View** — renders the model's data to the user. In a web application the view is typically an HTML template; in a desktop application it is a window or form. The view should contain minimal logic — only enough to display data.
- **Controller** — handles user input, manipulates the model in response, and selects which view to render. In a web framework the controller maps HTTP requests to actions.

The core benefit is **separation of concerns**: UI rendering logic, business logic, and input handling each live in their own layer and can change independently.

```
User Input ──▶ Controller ──▶ Model
                    │            │
                    └──▶ View ◀──┘
```

MVC originated in Smalltalk-80 in the late 1970s and was popularised on the web by frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Django, and ASP.NET MVC.

## MVC Participants

### Model

The model encapsulates state and behavior. In a well-structured application the model contains [domain entities](/domain-driven-design/entity/), services, and [repository](/design-patterns/repository-pattern/) abstractions. It has no dependency on the view or controller.

See [Kinds of Models](/terms/kinds-of-models/) for a breakdown of the different model types that commonly appear in MVC applications (domain model, view model, binding model, API model, persistence model).

### View

The view receives a model (or view model — see below) and renders it. In ASP.NET Core MVC this is a Razor `.cshtml` file. The view does not manipulate the model directly; it just displays what it is given.

### Controller

The controller receives an HTTP request, calls the appropriate model/service layer, and returns a view result. A healthy controller is thin — it orchestrates, it does not contain business logic.

```csharp
public class OrdersController : Controller
{
    private readonly IOrderService _orderService;

    public OrdersController(IOrderService orderService)
    {
        _orderService = orderService;
    }

    public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
    {
        var orders = await _orderService.GetRecentOrdersAsync();
        var viewModel = orders.Select(o => new OrderSummaryViewModel(o)).ToList();
        return View(viewModel);
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Place(PlaceOrderRequest request)
    {
        await _orderService.PlaceOrderAsync(request);
        return RedirectToAction(nameof(Index));
    }
}
```

## ViewModels Inside MVC

The original MVC pattern passes domain model objects directly to the view. In practice this rarely scales well: views often need data aggregated from multiple models, display-only computed properties, or formatting that doesn't belong on a domain entity.

The solution is to introduce a **ViewModel** — a class shaped precisely to what a specific view needs:

```csharp
public class OrderSummaryViewModel
{
    public int OrderId { get; init; }
    public string CustomerName { get; init; } = "";
    public string StatusDisplay { get; init; } = "";
    public decimal Total { get; init; }
    public string TotalFormatted => Total.ToString("C");
}
```

The controller maps from the domain model to the view model before passing it to the view. This keeps the domain model clean, prevents views from depending on persistence-level concerns, and gives each view exactly the shape of data it needs.

This is sometimes called the **MVC + ViewModel** approach. It is so common — especially in ASP.NET MVC / ASP.NET Core — that ViewModels are virtually always present in production MVC web applications. See the [REPR Design Pattern](/design-patterns/repr-design-pattern/) for discussion of how even this adaptation struggles for API-only scenarios.

## MVC vs. MVP vs. MVVM

MVC is one of a family of closely related patterns. All three separate model from presentation, but they differ in *how* the three parts communicate and where logic lives.

### [Model-View-Presenter (MVP)](/design-patterns/mvp-pattern/)

MVP replaces the controller with a **Presenter** that has a direct, two-way relationship with the View via an interface:

| Aspect | MVC | MVP |
|---|---|---|
| View awareness | View is passive; controller selects it | View and Presenter communicate through an interface |
| Testability | Controller is testable; view is harder | Presenter is fully testable via the view interface |
| Coupling | Controller does not hold a reference to a specific view instance | Presenter holds a reference to the view interface |

MVP is common in WinForms, Android (pre-Architecture Components), and other frameworks where the view is a concrete object the presenter can poke directly. The Presenter can fully test the presentation logic because all view interaction goes through an interface. See the [MVP pattern article](/design-patterns/mvp-pattern/) for a full treatment including Passive View vs. Supervising Controller variants.

### [Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)](/design-patterns/mvvm-pattern/)

MVVM replaces the controller with a **ViewModel** that exposes observable properties and commands. The View *data-binds* to the ViewModel; no imperative code in the ViewModel needs to know the View exists.

| Aspect | MVC | MVVM |
|---|---|---|
| View update mechanism | Controller explicitly selects/renders the view | Data binding — view automatically reflects ViewModel state |
| ViewModel role | Optional presentation-shaping DTO | Core participant; exposes commands and observable state |
| Typical platforms | Web (server-rendered), REST APIs | WPF, WinUI, MAUI, Blazor, Angular, Vue |

MVVM is the dominant pattern on data-binding-rich platforms. The ViewModel knows nothing about the View; the View observes the ViewModel through the platform's binding engine. See the [MVVM pattern article](/design-patterns/mvvm-pattern/) for a full treatment including commands and testability.

### Summary

| | MVC | MVP | MVVM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mediator between Model and View | Controller | Presenter | ViewModel |
| View updates | Controller pushes | Presenter pushes via interface | Binding pulls automatically |
| Testability of UI logic | Medium | High (via view interface mocks) | High (ViewModel has no UI deps) |
| Best suited for | Server-rendered web, REST | Traditional desktop/mobile | Data-binding platforms |

In practice the lines blur — many real-world ASP.NET Core applications use MVC structure with ViewModels almost to the point of [MVVM](/design-patterns/mvvm-pattern/) on the front end, and Razor Pages in ASP.NET Core is closer to [MVP](/design-patterns/mvp-pattern/) than MVC.

## Intent

Separate the concerns of data (Model), presentation (View), and input handling (Controller) so that each can be developed and tested independently.
