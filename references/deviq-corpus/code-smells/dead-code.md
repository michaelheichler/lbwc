Dead code is code that is never executed, never reached, or no longer serves any purpose in the running application. It may be a method that is never called, a variable that is assigned but never read, a branch that can never be taken, or an entire class that has been replaced but not removed. Dead code accumulates silently over time as features change, requirements shift, and code is refactored without cleaning up what remains.

The danger of dead code is not just clutter. It confuses readers who wonder whether the code serves some purpose they are missing. It must be read, understood, and maintained even though it provides no value. It can trigger compiler warnings, inflate code coverage numbers misleadingly, and — in some cases — cause confusion when someone accidentally revives it or builds on top of it.

## Forms of Dead Code

### Unreachable Code

Code that appears after an unconditional `return`, `throw`, or other exit statement in a method is unreachable. The compiler or linter often flags this, but more subtle cases appear when logic changes leave blocks that can never be entered:

```csharp
public decimal CalculateDiscount(OrderType type)
{
    if (type == OrderType.Retail)
        return 0.05m;

    return 0m;

    // This block is unreachable
    if (type == OrderType.Wholesale)
        return 0.15m;
}
```

### Unused Variables and Parameters

A variable that is declared and assigned but never read serves no purpose. An unused parameter signals that the method's interface has drifted from its implementation. Both are forms of dead code:

```csharp
public string BuildGreeting(string name, string unused)
{
    var prefix = "Hello"; // prefix is assigned but never used if written this way:
    return $"Hello, {name}!";
}
```

### Methods and Properties That Are Never Called

A `public` method may still be dead code if no code path in the running application ever calls it. This is common when a feature is removed but only part of the supporting code is deleted. Internal (non-public) methods that have no callers are easier to detect with static analysis.

### Commented-Out Code

Blocks of code that have been commented out are a common form of dead code. They persist because developers are reluctant to delete code they might need later. Version control renders this hesitation unnecessary — deleted code can always be recovered from history. See also: [Comments](/code-smells/comments/).

### Obsolete Feature Flags and Configuration

A feature flag that is always `true` or always `false` produces dead branches. When a feature is fully rolled out or permanently disabled, the flag and the branch it guards become dead code and should be removed.

### Unused Classes and Types

Entire classes, interfaces, or enumerations that are never instantiated or implemented are dead code at the type level. These are especially common after refactoring efforts that restructure functionality without removing the old types.

## Why Dead Code Accumulates

Dead code is rarely introduced intentionally. It accumulates because:

- A feature is removed but the supporting code is not cleaned up fully.
- A refactoring replaces an old implementation, but the original is left in place.
- A developer comments out code "temporarily" and never returns to it.
- A parameter or overload is added in anticipation of a need that never arose.
- Copy-paste leads to code that is never wired up or invoked.

## Addressing Dead Code

The remedy for dead code is straightforward: **delete it**. Version control preserves history, so there is no need to retain dead code as a safety net.

Static analysis tools can identify many forms of dead code automatically — unused variables, unreachable branches, methods with no callers (within a project). Tools like Roslyn analyzers for C#, SonarQube, or IDE inspections in JetBrains Rider and Visual Studio are effective at surfacing this.

For large codebases, addressing dead code incrementally is more practical:

1. Enable and act on compiler/analyzer warnings for unused code.
2. Use code coverage reports to identify methods that are never exercised.
3. Review feature flags periodically and remove those that are no longer toggled.
4. Make dead code removal part of code review and definition of done.
