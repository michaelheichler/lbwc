Conditional Complexity is a code smell where the logic of a program is controlled by a growing web of `if/else` chains, nested conditionals, or duplicated `switch` statements. While a single conditional is rarely a problem, complex conditional logic tends to spread — the same type-check or flag appears in multiple methods, branches nest three or four levels deep, and adding a new case means touching several different places in the codebase.

Conditional Complexity is closely related to [Switch Statements](./switch-statements), which specifically addresses type-based dispatch using `switch` or `if/else if` chains. Conditional Complexity is the broader pattern: any situation where the volume and structure of conditional logic makes the code hard to read, test, and extend.

Two metrics are commonly used to measure Conditional Complexity objectively:

- **[Cyclomatic Complexity](/terms/cyclomatic-complexity/)** — counts the number of independent execution paths through a method. Each `if`, `else if`, `case`, `&&`, `||`, and loop adds one to the score. It is a strong predictor of testing effort: a method with a cyclomatic complexity of 10 needs at least 10 test cases for full branch coverage.
- **[Cognitive Complexity](/terms/cognitive-complexity/)** — measures how hard the code is to *understand*. It penalizes nesting more heavily than flat branching, reflecting the human experience of reading code. A long but flat `switch` statement scores low; deeply nested `if` chains score high even with fewer total branches.

Using both metrics together helps identify methods that are both hard to test and hard to read.

## Problems Caused by Conditional Complexity

### Reduced Readability

Deeply nested or heavily branched code requires a reader to hold many states in their head simultaneously. The more conditions are stacked, the harder it is to trace any single path through the logic.

### Difficult to Test

Every branch in a conditional is a separate execution path that ideally needs its own test. A method with five nested `if` statements can have dozens of distinct paths, each requiring a test case. This combinatorial growth is a direct consequence of [Combinatorial Explosion](./combinatorial-explosion).

### Violation of the Open/Closed Principle

When adding a new case requires modifying an existing conditional — adding an `else if` arm or a `case` to a `switch` — the code is not closed for modification. The [Open/Closed Principle](/principles/open-closed-principle/) asks that existing code remain unchanged when new behavior is added.

### Duplication

Type-checking or state-checking logic often migrates: the same `if (type == "premium")` check appears in the discount method, the shipping method, the notification method, and the reporting method. When the rules change, every copy must be found and updated — a classic [Shotgun Surgery](./shotgun-surgery) situation.

### Fragile Code

Complex conditionals are easy to break when modified. A misplaced `else`, an overlooked `&&`, or a missing case can introduce subtle bugs that are hard to trace back to the branching logic.

## Example

An order discount calculation with growing conditional complexity:

```csharp
public decimal CalculateDiscount(Order order)
{
    decimal discount = 0;

    if (order.CustomerType == "Premium")
    {
        if (order.Total > 1000)
        {
            discount = order.Total * 0.20m;
        }
        else if (order.Total > 500)
        {
            discount = order.Total * 0.15m;
        }
        else
        {
            discount = order.Total * 0.10m;
        }
    }
    else if (order.CustomerType == "Standard")
    {
        if (order.Total > 1000)
        {
            discount = order.Total * 0.10m;
        }
        else if (order.Total > 500)
        {
            discount = order.Total * 0.05m;
        }
    }
    else if (order.CustomerType == "Trial")
    {
        discount = 0;
    }

    return discount;
}
```

Adding a new customer type or a new tier threshold requires modifying this method directly. The logic is hard to test in isolation and will only grow more entangled.

After applying the Strategy pattern and replacing conditionals with polymorphism:

```csharp
public interface IDiscountPolicy
{
    decimal Calculate(Order order);
}

public class PremiumDiscountPolicy : IDiscountPolicy
{
    public decimal Calculate(Order order) => order.Total switch
    {
        > 1000 => order.Total * 0.20m,
        > 500  => order.Total * 0.15m,
        _      => order.Total * 0.10m,
    };
}

public class StandardDiscountPolicy : IDiscountPolicy
{
    public decimal Calculate(Order order) => order.Total switch
    {
        > 1000 => order.Total * 0.10m,
        > 500  => order.Total * 0.05m,
        _      => 0m,
    };
}

public class NoDiscountPolicy : IDiscountPolicy
{
    public decimal Calculate(Order order) => 0m;
}

public class OrderService
{
    private readonly IDiscountPolicy _discountPolicy;

    public OrderService(IDiscountPolicy discountPolicy)
        => _discountPolicy = discountPolicy;

    public decimal CalculateDiscount(Order order)
        => _discountPolicy.Calculate(order);
}
```

Each policy is independently testable. Adding a new customer type means adding a new class, not modifying existing code.

## Addressing Conditional Complexity

- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism** — move each branch into a subclass or strategy object that implements a shared interface. The caller depends on the interface; the branching disappears.
- **[Strategy Pattern](/design-patterns/strategy-pattern/)** — encapsulate each variant of an algorithm in its own class and inject the appropriate strategy at construction or call time.
- **[State Pattern](/design-patterns/state-design-pattern/)** — when the conditionals are driven by an object's internal state, replace state flags with dedicated state objects that encapsulate the behavior for each state.
- **Introduce a polymorphic factory** — use a factory or dictionary lookup to map a type or key to the correct handler, eliminating `switch` statements that construct objects.
- **Guard Clauses** — flatten nested conditionals by returning or throwing early for edge cases, keeping the happy path unindented and readable.
- **Apply the [Open/Closed Principle](/principles/open-closed-principle/)** — design so that new cases can be added as new types without modifying existing conditional logic.
