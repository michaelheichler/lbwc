The Long Method code smell refers to methods or functions that have grown too large, taking on too many responsibilities. Long methods are difficult to read at a glance, hard to name expressively, and challenging to reuse or test in isolation. They often arise incrementally as developers add logic to an existing method rather than extracting new, well-named methods.

As a rule of thumb, a method that doesn't fit on a single screen, requires scrolling to read in full, or needs to be parsed carefully to understand its purpose is a candidate for [refactoring](/practices/refactoring/). The exact threshold varies by team and language, but many practitioners aim for methods that are 10–20 lines or fewer. More important than line count, though, is whether the method does *one thing* — that is, whether it operates at a single level of abstraction and can be summarized with a single, clear name.

## Problems Caused by Long Methods

### Poor Readability

Long methods force the reader to hold more context in their head at once. Instead of reading a high-level summary of what a method does, the reader is forced to trace through implementation details step by step. This makes it much harder to understand the code quickly and increases the cognitive load required to work with it.

### Violation of the Single Responsibility Principle

Most long methods are long *because* they do more than one thing. They mix orchestration with implementation, validation with business logic, or data access with presentation. This violates the [Single Responsibility Principle](/principles/single-responsibility-principle/) and leads to tightly coupled code that is hard to change without unintended side effects.

### Difficult to Test

Long methods typically have more code paths and more dependencies, making unit testing harder. A method that does many things needs many tests to cover all its branches. Extracting smaller, focused methods makes individual pieces of logic easier to test in isolation and leads to a clearer, more maintainable test suite.

### Limited Reusability

Logic buried inside a large method cannot be reused elsewhere. When a similar need arises in another context, developers often resort to [copy-paste programming](/antipatterns/copy-paste-programming/) rather than calling a shared, well-named method. Extracting logic into smaller methods unlocks reuse and reduces duplication.

### Harder to Name

A method doing many things cannot be named accurately with a single verb phrase. Names like `ProcessOrder`, `HandleRequest`, or `DoEverything` are signs that the method has too many responsibilities. Good method names are concise and specific; long methods resist this.

### Increased Merge Conflicts

Large methods are more likely to be edited by multiple developers simultaneously, leading to merge conflicts. Smaller, focused methods reduce the surface area of changes and minimize the chance of conflicting edits.

## Example

Below is an example of a long method that handles too many concerns at once:

```csharp
public void ProcessOrder(Order order)
{
    // Validate
    if (order == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(order));
    if (!order.Items.Any()) throw new InvalidOperationException("Order has no items.");
    if (order.CustomerId <= 0) throw new InvalidOperationException("Invalid customer ID.");

    // Calculate total
    decimal subtotal = 0;
    foreach (var item in order.Items)
    {
        subtotal += item.Quantity * item.UnitPrice;
    }
    decimal tax = subtotal * 0.08m;
    decimal total = subtotal + tax;
    order.Total = total;

    // Apply discount
    if (order.CustomerIsVip)
    {
        order.Total *= 0.90m;
    }

    // Save to database
    _dbContext.Orders.Add(order);
    _dbContext.SaveChanges();

    // Send confirmation email
    var subject = $"Order #{order.Id} Confirmation";
    var body = $"Thank you for your order. Total: {order.Total:C}";
    _emailService.Send(order.CustomerEmail, subject, body);
}
```

This method validates input, calculates totals, applies discounts, persists data, and sends email — five distinct concerns in one method.

## Addressing Long Methods

The primary refactoring technique for Long Method is **Extract Method**: identify a cohesive block of code within the method, move it to a new private (or public) method with a descriptive name, and replace the original block with a call to that new method.

After extraction, the original method reads like a high-level summary:

```csharp
public void ProcessOrder(Order order)
{
    ValidateOrder(order);
    CalculateOrderTotal(order);
    ApplyVipDiscount(order);
    SaveOrder(order);
    SendConfirmationEmail(order);
}
```

Each extracted method is now small, named, and independently testable.

### Other Techniques

- **Replace Temp with Query** — replace local variables that compute a value with a method call.
- **Decompose Conditional** — extract the condition and each branch of a complex `if`/`else` into separate methods.
- **Introduce Parameter Object** — when a long method has a long parameter list, group related parameters into a class.
- **Move Method** — if extracted logic naturally belongs to another class, move it there.
- **Apply the [Single Responsibility Principle](/principles/single-responsibility-principle/)** — each method should have one reason to change.
