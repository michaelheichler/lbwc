The Inconsistency code smell occurs when similar problems are solved in different ways, when the same concept is named differently in different places, or when coding conventions vary across a codebase without a clear reason. Consistency is a form of communication: when a codebase follows consistent patterns, readers can apply what they learn in one place to understand another. When patterns vary arbitrarily, every part of the codebase requires fresh interpretation.

Inconsistency is sometimes described as a sibling of the [Oddball Solution](./oddball-solution) smell. Where Oddball Solution specifically focuses on multiple implementations of the same algorithmic or technical problem, Inconsistency is broader — it encompasses naming, structure, error handling, formatting, and any other dimension where arbitrary variation creates confusion.

## Problems Caused by Inconsistency

### Increased Reading Effort

When conventions vary, readers cannot rely on patterns. They must approach each piece of code fresh, asking whether a variation is meaningful (and therefore worth understanding) or accidental (and therefore ignorable). This question consumes cognitive resources on every read.

### False Signal of Intentionality

When a codebase is inconsistent, developers begin to wonder whether every variation is intentional. A different naming style, a different error-handling pattern, a different structural approach — each becomes a potential puzzle. In a consistent codebase, genuine differences stand out; in an inconsistent one, signal is buried in noise.

### Duplication and Divergence

Inconsistently named concepts tend to be independently implemented rather than shared. If `userId` in one module and `uid` in another refer to the same concept, they may evolve independently, eventually diverging in behavior. The [Don't Repeat Yourself](/principles/dont-repeat-yourself/) principle depends on being able to recognize repetition; inconsistent names make that recognition harder.

### Onboarding Friction

New team members learn by analogy. If the first module they encounter uses one set of conventions and the second uses another, there is no pattern to learn — only a series of exceptions. Consistent codebases are far easier to onboard into.

### Maintenance Risk

When the same operation (logging, error handling, null checking) is performed inconsistently, changes require finding and updating every variation rather than a single canonical implementation. Inconsistency is a form of hidden duplication that magnifies maintenance cost.

## Example

Consider a set of repository methods where conventions vary:

```csharp
// Different return patterns for the same operation
public User GetUser(int id) { ... }           // Returns null if not found
public Product FetchProduct(int id) { ... }   // Throws if not found
public Order FindOrder(int id) { ... }        // Returns default(Order) if not found

// Different naming for related concepts
public void SaveUser(User user) { ... }
public void StoreProduct(Product product) { ... }
public void PersistOrder(Order order) { ... }

// Different parameter names for the same concept
public Invoice GetInvoice(int invoiceId) { ... }
public Receipt GetReceipt(int id) { ... }
public Statement GetStatement(int statementID) { ... }
```

Each variation forces readers to re-examine familiar patterns. A consistent repository interface would use the same naming conventions, the same return patterns, and the same parameter naming throughout.

## Refactoring

- Establish and document **naming conventions** for the codebase (e.g., how repositories are named, how IDs are named, how null cases are handled).
- Use **Rename Method** and **Rename Variable** to bring divergent names into alignment with the chosen convention.
- Extract a **common interface or base class** to enforce consistent method signatures across similar types.
- Use **linters and static analysis** to automatically enforce style conventions.
- Address inconsistencies during code review before they propagate.
